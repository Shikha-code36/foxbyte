// The object store's images come from FoxByte's own registry.
//
// MinIO's images have moved twice. They left Docker Hub in 2026, and then quay.io
// stopped serving them anonymously: every tag there, `latest` included, answers
// 401 to a pull without credentials. The engine runs MinIO for the WAL archive and
// base backups, so the day that changed, a fresh install on macOS or Linux could
// no longer start — while existing installs carried on from their local cache, and
// Windows carried on because its distro image has always shipped the images inside
// it (deploy/wsl-distro/build.sh).
//
// So they are mirrored to ghcr.io/thefoxbyte, beside the engine image, by
// .github/workflows/mirror-images.yml — which takes them out of a published
// release's distro asset rather than from a registry that will not serve us. The
// versions are the ones FoxByte is tested with; the digests are what that workflow
// pushed, and it can be re-run with them to check that a tag still resolves to the
// same bytes (audit v2 G23).
