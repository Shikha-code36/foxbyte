// How a person connects to a branch.
//
// Two different things were both called "connecting", and neither was easy to
// find. From an application you go through the gateway on :6432, where the
// database name is the branch and the password is an API key. From this machine
// you need no key at all: the engine opens psql inside the branch's own
// container. `fox connect` does the second and prints the first, because until
// now `fox psql` only ever opened main and `fox branch create` printed a Docker
// container id.

// KeyPlaceholder stands in for the API key in a printed connection string.
// Nothing mints a key here on purpose: a key is a credential, and it belongs to
// the person who will use it, created when they ask for it.
const KeyPlaceholder = "<API_KEY>"

// GatewayDSN is the connection string an application uses for a branch. With an
// empty key it carries KeyPlaceholder, so the shape is right and the missing
// secret is obvious.
